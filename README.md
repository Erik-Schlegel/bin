# Linux Customizations
My ongoing growing (ongrowing?) collection of helper bash scripts which maximize ~~laziness~~ efficiency.

## Instructions
- Clone to ~/
  ` https://github.com/Erik-Schlegel/bin.git `
- Create a copy of the config file, and source it from ~/.bashrc
  `cp ~/bin/__bashrc_supplemental ~/bin/.bashrc_supplemental && sed -i '$a\. ~/bin/.bashrc_supplemental' ~/.bashrc`
- Populate variables in /bin/.bashrc_supplemental
- Restart your terminal.
- Enjoy the increase in your efficiency.
