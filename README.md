# Linux Customizations
My ongoing growing (ongrowing?) collection of helper bash scripts which maximize --laziness-- efficiency.

## Instructions
- Clone this repo to ~/
- `cp /bin/__bashrc_supplemental /bin/.bashrc_supplemental && sed -i '$a\. ~/bin/.bashrc_supplemental' ~/.bashrc`
- Populate variables in /bin/.bashrc_supplemental
- Restart your terminal.
